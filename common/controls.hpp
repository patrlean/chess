Objective:
Use the common.cpp file from the Git Tutorial and add a custom function
for ECE6122 Labs. It does NOT touch the existing functions.

// A custom function for Lab3
// Creates the view and Projection matrix based on following custom key definitions
// keyboard inputs definitions
//1) ‘w’ key moves the camera radially closer to the origin.
//2) ‘s’ key moves the camera radially farther from the origin.
//3) ‘a’ key rotates the camera to the left maintaining the radial distance from the origin.
//4) ‘d’ key rotates to camera to the right maintaining the radial distance from the origin.
//5) The up arrow key radially rotates the camera up.
//6) The down arrow radially rotates the camera down.
//7) The ‘L’ key toggles the specular and diffuse components of the light on and off but leaves the ambient component unchanged.
//8) Pressing the escape key closes the window and exits the program
